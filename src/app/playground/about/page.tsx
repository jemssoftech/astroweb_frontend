              nybody who has studied Vedic Astrology knows well how accurate it
              can be. But also how complex it can get to make accurate
              predictions. It takes decades of experience to be able to make
              accurate prediction. Thus, this knowledge only reaches a limited
              people. This project is an effort to change that.

                Our goal is to make Vedic Astrology easily accessible to
                anybody. So that people can use it in their daily lives for
                their benefit. Vedic Astrology in Sanskrit means{" "}
                <strong>"Light"</strong> and that is exactly what it is. It
                lights our future so we can change it. And it lights our past,
                to understand our mistakes.

                Using modern computational technologies & methods we can{" "}
                <strong>simplify the complexity</strong> of Vedic Astrology. For
                example, calculating planet strength (Bhava Bala) used to take
                hours, now with computers we can calculate it in
                <strong>milliseconds</strong>. Combining databases & innovative
                programming methods. There's no need to remember thousands of
                planetary combinations, allowing you to make{" "}

                knowledge.

                It is told in the stories of old, that a heathen god moved by
                the plight of a child. Gave onto him the knowledge of the stars
                as compensation for the tears. The child in turn passed that
                gift to every soul he knew, with no check on price or pedigree.
                And so astrology was born.

                As such this knowledge stands as an opportunity for every soul
                to realize that even though we play a role in the world, we are
                not made of it. That we are <strong>souls</strong> first! And
                the planets do not have a say on it.
